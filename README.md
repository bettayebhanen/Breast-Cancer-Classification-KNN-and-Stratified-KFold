# Breast-Cancer-Classification-KNN-and-Stratified-KFold
Building on the initial KNN model that achieved 96.5% accuracy, this phase focuses on enhancing reliability and robustness using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.

## üìã Project Overview

While a single train-test split gives a quick performance snapshot, it can sometimes misrepresent how stable a model truly is.
To ensure trustworthy performance, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, this project implements Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation ‚Äî a method that preserves class balance across folds and provides a more accurate estimate of model reliability

## üéØ Results

**Cross-Validation**:

**Average Accuracy**: 96.48%

**Observation**: Stable and consistent performance across all folds.

**Final Test Evaluation**:

**Accuracy**: 96.49%

**Misclassifications**: Only 4 out of 114 test cases

**Observation**: 99% success rate in detecting malignant cases
